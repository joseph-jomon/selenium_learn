To select the `<a>` element with the class `cta cta--homepage`, you can use either the `By.CLASS_NAME` or `By.CSS_SELECTOR` approach. Here are the differences and how to use each approach:

### Using `By.CLASS_NAME`
This approach is simpler when you want to select an element by a single class name. However, it does not support multiple class names directly.

```python
# Locate the "EU Login" button by class name and click it
accept_eulogin_button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "cta--homepage")
accept_eulogin_button.click()
```

### Using `By.CSS_SELECTOR`
This approach is more flexible and powerful. It allows you to use complex CSS selectors, including multiple class names, element types, and other attributes.

```python
# Locate the "EU Login" button by CSS selector and click it
accept_eulogin_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "a.cta.cta--homepage")
accept_eulogin_button.click()
```

### Explanation
- **`By.CLASS_NAME`**: Use this when you need to find an element by a single class name. It is straightforward but limited to single class names.
- **`By.CSS_SELECTOR`**: Use this when you need more flexibility, such as selecting elements by multiple class names, element types, or other attributes. It is more versatile and powerful.

### Updated Code Example
Here's how you can update your code to use the `By.CSS_SELECTOR` approach for both elements:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open the webpage
driver.get("https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/welcome")

# Loading can take time
driver.implicitly_wait(5)  # Time to wait for the page to load; don't have to wait for the complete duration if the page loads faster

# Locate the "Accept all cookies" button by CSS selector and click it
try:
    accept_cookies_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "a.wt-ecl-button.wt-ecl-button--primary.cck-actions-button")
    accept_cookies_button.click()
except:
    print("No cookies button found")

# Locate the "EU Login" button by CSS selector and click it
accept_eulogin_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "a.cta.cta--homepage")
accept_eulogin_button.click()
```

This code uses CSS selectors to locate and interact with the elements, providing more flexibility and precision.
