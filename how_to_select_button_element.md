#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To select the "Next" button, you can use various methods such as `By.NAME`, `By.CLASS_NAME`, or `By.CSS_SELECTOR`. Here are a few ways to do it:

### Using `By.NAME`
You can select the button by its `name` attribute:
```python
submit_button = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "whoamiSubmit")
submit_button.click()
```

### Using `By.CLASS_NAME`
You can select the button by one of its class names:
```python
submit_button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "btn-next")
submit_button.click()
```

### Using `By.CSS_SELECTOR`
You can use a CSS selector to select the button by its class names or other attributes:
```python
submit_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "button.btn.btn-primary.btn-next.mt-0")
submit_button.click()
```

### Updated Code Example
Here's how you can update your code to include the selection and clicking of the "Next" button:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open the webpage
driver.get("https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/welcome")

# Loading can take time
driver.implicitly_wait(5)  # Time to wait for the page to load; don't have to wait for the complete duration if the page loads faster

# Locate the "Accept all cookies" button by class name and click it
try:
    accept_cookies_button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "wt-ecl-button--primary")
    accept_cookies_button.click()
except:
    print("No cookies button found")

# Locate the "EU Login" button by class name and click it
accept_eulogin_button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "cta--homepage")
accept_eulogin_button.click()

# Enter email in the email field
email_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "username")
email_field.send_keys("support@cust-ai.com")

# Locate the "Next" button by CSS selector and click it
submit_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "button.btn.btn-primary.btn-next.mt-0")
submit_button.click()
```

This code uses the `By.CSS_SELECTOR` method to locate and click the "Next" button. You can choose any of the methods mentioned above based on your preference and the specific attributes of the button.
