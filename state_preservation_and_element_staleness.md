You are correct that if you have a collection of links, you can iterate over them and perform the download operations without navigating back to the original page each time. This approach can be more efficient and straightforward.

However, there are a few considerations:
1. **State Preservation**: If the page state changes after clicking a link (e.g., elements are removed or modified), you might need to navigate back to restore the original state.
2. **Element Staleness**: If you navigate away from the page, the references to the elements might become stale, causing `StaleElementReferenceException`. This can be avoided by collecting the URLs first and then navigating to each URL.

Here's an updated approach where you collect the URLs first and then navigate to each URL to perform the download operations:

### Updated Code Example
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open the webpage
driver.get("https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/welcome")

# Loading can take time
driver.implicitly_wait(5)  # Time to wait for the page to load; don't have to wait for the complete duration if the page loads faster

# Locate the "Accept all cookies" button by class name and click it
try:
    accept_cookies_button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "wt-ecl-button--primary")
    accept_cookies_button.click()
except:
    print("No cookies button found")

# Locate the "EU Login" button by class name and click it
accept_eulogin_button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "cta--homepage")
accept_eulogin_button.click()

# Enter email in the email field
email_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "username")
email_field.send_keys("support@cust-ai.com")

# Locate the "Next" button by CSS selector and click it
submit_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "button.btn.btn-primary.btn-next.mt-0")
submit_button.click()

# Enter password in the password field
password_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "password")
password_field.send_keys("TheFutureofCustoms123!#")

# Click the "Sign in" button using the name attribute
sign_in_button = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "_submit")
sign_in_button.click()

# Wait for the page to load and locate the section containing the links
WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "section.not-seen-content")))

# Locate all the links within the section
links = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "section.not-seen-content a.link-max-width")

# Collect the URLs of all links
urls = [link.get_attribute("href") for link in links]

# Iterate over each URL
for url in urls:
    print(f"Navigating to: {url}")
    
    # Open the URL
    driver.get(url)
    
    # Perform actions on the new page (e.g., download PDF)
    # Add your code here to handle the download
    
    # Optionally, navigate back to the original page if needed
    # driver.back()

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```

### Explanation
1. **Collect URLs**: Collect the URLs of all links first to avoid `StaleElementReferenceException`.
2. **Navigate to Each URL**: Iterate over the collected URLs and navigate to each URL to perform the download operations.
3. **Optional Navigation Back**: If needed, you can navigate back to the original page using `driver.back()`.

This approach ensures that you can efficiently navigate to each link and perform the necessary actions without encountering issues related to element staleness or page state changes.
