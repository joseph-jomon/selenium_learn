It looks like the CSS selector you used might not be specific enough to uniquely identify the "Sign in" button. If there are multiple buttons with the classes `btn btn-primary mt-0`, the selector might be finding the wrong one.

To make the CSS selector more specific, you can include additional attributes such as the `name` or `value` attribute.

Here's an updated example using a more specific CSS selector:

```python
# Locate the "Sign in" button by a more specific CSS selector and click it
sign_in_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "button[name='_submit'][value='Sign in']")
sign_in_button.click()
```

Alternatively, you can use the `By.NAME` method:

```python
# Locate the "Sign in" button by name and click it
sign_in_button = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "_submit")
sign_in_button.click()
```

### Updated Code Example
Here's your updated code with the more specific CSS selector for the "Sign in" button:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# Initialize the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open the webpage
driver.get("https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/welcome")

# Loading can take time
driver.implicitly_wait(5)  # Time to wait for the page to load; don't have to wait for the complete duration if the page loads faster

# Locate the "Accept all cookies" button by class name and click it
try:
    accept_cookies_button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "wt-ecl-button--primary")
    accept_cookies_button.click()
except:
    print("No cookies button found")

# Locate the "EU Login" button by class name and click it
accept_eulogin_button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "cta--homepage")
accept_eulogin_button.click()

# Enter email in the email field
email_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "username")
email_field.send_keys("support@cust-ai.com")

# Locate the "Next" button by CSS selector and click it
submit_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "button.btn.btn-primary.btn-next.mt-0")
submit_button.click()

# Enter password in the password field
password_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "password")
password_field.send_keys("TheFutureofCustoms123!#")

# Click the "Sign in" button using a more specific CSS selector
sign_in_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "button[name='_submit'][value='Sign in']")
sign_in_button.click()
```

This should help you correctly locate and click the "Sign in" button. If you still encounter issues, please provide more details about the error or behavior you're seeing.
