# Selenium Email Form Automation Script

This script automates filling an email form and clicking the "Next" button using Selenium.

## Explanation

### Import necessary modules:
- `webdriver` from `selenium` is used to control the browser.
- `By` is used to locate elements by different strategies (ID, XPATH, etc.).
- `Keys` is used to simulate keyboard inputs.
- `WebDriverWait` and `expected_conditions` are used for waiting until certain conditions are met (e.g., element is present, visible).
- `TimeoutException` is used to handle timeout errors.

### `fill_form_and_click_next(driver, email)` function:
- Takes the `driver` (the browser instance) and the `email` as input.
- Uses `WebDriverWait` to wait for the email input field (`id="username"`) to be present in the DOM and visible. This is important because the page might take some time to load.
- `email_input.clear()`: Clears any existing text in the input field.
- `email_input.send_keys(email)`: Sends the provided email to the input field.
- Finds the "Next" button container using `By.XPATH`, `"//div[@class='row']"`. This locates the `<div>` element with the class "row".
- Finds the "Next" button inside the container using `By.XPATH`, `".//button[contains(text(), 'Next')]"`. This locates a `<button>` element that contains the text "Next" within the container.
- `next_button.click()`: Clicks the "Next" button.
- Includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential `TimeoutException` (if an element is not found within the timeout) and other exceptions.

### Example Usage (commented out):
```python
# driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Creates a new Chrome browser instance. You can replace `Chrome()` with `Firefox()`, `Edge()`, etc., if you want to use a different browser.
# driver.get("your_page_url")  # Navigates to the URL of the page you want to automate. You need to replace `"your_page_url"` with the actual URL.
# fill_form_and_click_next(driver, "test@example.com")  # Calls the function to fill the form and click "Next". Replace `"test@example.com"` with the email you want to use.
# driver.quit()  # Closes the browser.
```

## How to use this script:
